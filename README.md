## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The advisors for a college wanted a program that held and displayed courses with information such as the course number, title, and prerequisites. They also wanted the program to be able to display the courses in alphanumeric order.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first created pseudocode for the 3 data structures that were proposed for use. The data structures were important to understand because they affect how the program will run. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Any roadblocks that were encountered, I felt comfortable handling myself. Common resources I used were documentation from either cplusplus.com or geeksforgeeks.org . Reading the documentation helped refresh my mind on how to implement various library functions I was not proficient with.
Also, sometimes encountering a problem and then taking a step away from the computer helped enormously. Being able to have a problem in mind, while doing other tasks throughout the day, helped me when I went back to the problem.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This work has helped solidify my skills and given me confidence in pursuing more difficult ventures in the future. I have grown more fond of pseudocode and its use in designing and developing software. It made developing these projects simple and only required a few tweaks here and there to fix inconsistencies.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Developing pseudocode, documenting my program and researching documentation helps ensure my programs will be maintainable, readable, and adaptable. There is a certain subjectivity when it comes to pseudocode, with some people claiming more is better and some that less is more. Ultimately, I think it depends on the level of the reader.
